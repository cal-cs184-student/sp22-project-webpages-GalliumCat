          <p>
              In this assignment, I implemented 2d and 3d bezier curves as well as flip/split/upsample operations on a mesh. These operations involved keeping track
              of numerous pointers and reassignments and creating a method to compute centroids. Overall, this assignment involved keeping many variables in my mind
              at a time to ensure the mesh remained consistent.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

          De Casteljau's algorithm works by repeatedly calculating linear interpolations of various control points until only one point is left. By varying t,
          the entire curve can be formed.

          <p>
              The same de Casteljau algorithm can also be applied to 3d space. To do this, the key insight is that a plane is formed by multiple curves, all which occupy a 2d space.
              Thus, applying the algorithm as if you were in a 2-d space, then using those outputs as another input to the algorithm allows evaluation of bezier surfaces.

          <p>
              I implemented area-weighted vertex normals by iterating over faces adjacent to a vertex and multiplying each normal by its norm. Then I averaged by the
              over the number of adjacent faces and normalized the resulting vector to get the resulting normal.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>

          <p>
              Edge flipping was performed using a diagram with every edge, half edge, vertex, and face labelled before/after. Using this diagram helped avoid
              all errors relating to confusing pointer reassignment.

          <p>
              Half edge splits were implemented in a similar manner. This time labels were implicit rather than written on the diagram, so there was a little
              more to keep track of mentally. Still, there were only a few hiccups in the forms of typos that were easily resolved.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

          <p>
              Upsampling was implemented by first computing vertex positions on the new mesh, subdividing the original mesh, then applying the precomputed positions
              onto the subdivided mesh. New vertex positions were the result of a weighted average of neighboring vertices. I used a vector to hold the original mesh's edges
              so that I could iterate over the original mesh's edges and split them without iterating across the newly split edges.

          </p>

          <p>
              Sharp edges and corners are rounded out by loop subdivision, which is an undesireable quality for many shapes like cubes.

              <br />
              <br />
              <div align="middle">
                  <img src="img/cubeUpsample.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                  <figcaption align="middle">Upsampling a cube's mesh</figcaption>
              </div>
          </p>

          <p>
              Increasing the number of triangles by splitting the faces into more triangles can help offset some of the rounding, but not by much. Many shapes
              like this cube also become mildly deformed by repeated subdivision. In the case of the cube, this deformation manifests as becoming asymmetric.
              This happens because the locations of new vertices are approximated using the surrounding vertices locations. Any small rounding errors can accumulate
              when the subdivide operation is repeated, forming small irregularities. These can be somewhat mitigated by splitting the faces into more triangles
              before subdividing.
          </p>

              <figcaption align="middle">Splitting the cube's face before upsampling</figcaption>
          </div>

          <p>
              In this scenario, the cube is split before upsampling, making the resulting subdivided mesh more symmetric and retaining a little more of the original
              cube shape. The more triangles on a face, the less the corners will deviate from their original positions as a result of the averaging function,
              allowing the original cube shape to be retained more.
